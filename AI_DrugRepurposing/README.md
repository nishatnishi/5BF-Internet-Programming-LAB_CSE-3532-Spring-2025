# **ðŸ§ª AI for Drug Repurposing â€“ Discovering New Uses for Existing Drugs**
An AI-powered system designed to identify potential new applications for existing drugs by leveraging machine learning and open biomedical datasets.

---

## ðŸ“Œ **About This Project**
**AI for Drug Repurposing** is a cutting-edge project that applies machine learning (ML) techniques to predict whether existing drugs can be repurposed to treat different diseases. This open-source project leverages public datasets like DrugBank, ChEMBL, and PubChem, providing an opportunity to speed up drug discovery and optimize the use of existing medications.

The project begins with a basic ML model and aims to expand to more advanced deep learning techniques in the future.

  - Preprocess and clean the data using **Pandas** and **NumPy**.
  - Train a basic machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees) using **Scikit-learn**.
  - Evaluate model performance (Accuracy, Precision, Recall).
  - Build a basic **Django web application** to input drug names and symptoms and display predictions.
  - Visualize the results using **Chart.js** or **Plotly** for a clean and interactive dashboard.

### ðŸ“… **Phase 2 - Advanced Model Development**

- **Goal**: Improve predictions using advanced AI techniques and larger, more complex datasets.
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement **Deep Learning models** like **Transformers** or **Graph Neural Networks** for more accurate drug repurposing predictions.
  - Collect more complex datasets, such as **clinical trial data** and **genetic data**.
  - Validate the model with **medical experts** to improve accuracy and reliability.
  - Write a research paper based on findings and submit to relevant **journals or conferences**.
  - Enhance the web app with additional features such as real-time data processing and user feedback.

### ðŸ“… **Phase 3 - Deployment & Testing**

- **Goal**: Deploy the model and web application for public use.
- **Tasks**:
  - Deploy the Django web app using cloud hosting platforms like **Heroku**, **Vercel**, or **Render**.
  - Test the web application for bugs and performance issues.
  - Add basic **documentation** and tutorials for users to understand how to use the system.
